Note that some countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not allow distribution of true postal addresses due to licensing restrictions.

For example, the address \&quot;111 8th Avenue, New York, NY\&quot; consists of the following components: \&quot;111\&quot; (the street number), \&quot;8th Avenue\&quot; (the route), \&quot;New York\&quot; (the city) and \&quot;NY\&quot; (the US state).  Do not parse the formatted address programmatically. Instead you should use the individual address components, which the API response includes in addition to the formatted address field.        | [optional]
