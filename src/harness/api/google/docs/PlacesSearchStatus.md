# PlacesSearchStatus

Status codes returned by service. - `OK` indicating the API request was successful. - `ZERO_RESULTS` indicating that the search was successful but returned no results. This may occur if the search was passed a `latlng` in a remote location. - `INVALID_REQUEST` indicating the API request was malformed, generally due to missing required query parameter (`location` or `radius`). - `OVER_QUERY_LIMIT` indicating any of the following:   - You have exceeded the QPS limits.   - Billing has not been enabled on your account.   - The monthly $200 credit, or a self-imposed usage cap, has been exceeded.   - The provided method of payment is no longer valid (for example, a credit card has expired).   See the [Maps FAQ](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#over-limit-key-error) for more information about how to resolve this error. - `REQUEST_DENIED` indicating that your request was denied, generally because:   - The request is missing an API key.   - The `key` parameter is invalid. - `UNKNOWN_ERROR` indicating an unknown error.
