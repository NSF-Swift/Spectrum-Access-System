# Data retrieval and processing scripts

This folder holds some of the scripts that were used to retrieve and preprocess data
used in the SAS reference implementation.

NOTE: other scripts related to US border zone are kept in the Winnforum 
[Common-Data repository](https://github.com/Wireless-Innovation-Forum/Common-Data), 
under the `scripts/` folder.

These scripts are provided only for documenting the process in generating those data.
You DO NOT need to run the scripts unless you want to verify the process.

Note: the sripts are supporting both Python2 and Python3, but the original data were
generated with Python2.
